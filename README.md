# solidifying_html_css
It's been approximately one week since I completed The Odin Project's HTML & CSS foundations project.

The aim of this project is to recreate another landing page by using the best practices of HTML & CSS.

By the completion of this project, my goal is to solidify my knowledge of HTML & CSS to create visually-pleasing web pages with minimal direction or assistance from any external source.

I also want to consolidate my habits of using command-line and Git commands to make meaningful commits to Github.
